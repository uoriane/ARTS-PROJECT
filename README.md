# Audit Recommendation Tracking System (ARTS)

## Overview

The **Audit Recommendation Tracking System (ARTS)** is a web-based system designed to support the Internal Audit and Integrity Department and the Quality Management System (QMS) team of the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA). Its core purpose is to automate, track, and monitor the implementation of audit recommendations across all RRA departments, divisions, and units.

ARTS centralizes audit findings and recommendations from **internal audits, external audits, and QMS audits**, providing real-time visibility into implementation progress, accountability, and compliance.
